# Project Roadmap

The Zomi Dictionary project is a long-term initiative to preserve and promote the Zomi language. Hereâ€™s our roadmap for the next 18 months:

---

## **Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1â€“3)**
- Launch open-source framework and initial dataset.
- Recruit a starter committee of Zomi speakers and linguists.
- Publish the first version of the dictionary with 500+ entries.

---

## **Phase 2: Data Enrichment (Months 4â€“9)**
- Expand the dataset to 50,000+ entries.
- Collect audio pronunciations for common words.
- Digitize Zomi Language and literature texts.
- Host a virtual "translation hackathon" for contributors.

---

## **Phase 3: AI/ML Development (Months 10â€“12)**
- Train and deploy foundational language models (e.g., NLLB, T5).
- Develop a demo translation app using Hugging Face or Gradio.
- Advocate for Zomi language inclusion in Google Translate.

---

## **Phase 4: Sustainability (Months 13â€“18)**
- Secure multi-year funding through grants and donations.
- Train community moderators for data validation.
- Launch a "Zomi Language Day" to celebrate and promote the language.

## **How You Can Help**
